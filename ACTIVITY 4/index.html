                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>Hi! I'm Mizona, Marion C., a passionate IT student with a strong love for self-learning and technology. I've always been fascinated by how computers work and how software shapes our world, which led me to pursue a career in Information Technology. My journey has been driven by curiosity, and I believe that the best way to truly master tech is through hands-on experience and constant self-study.
                    While formal education is important, I'm a firm believer that technology is constantly evolving, and the best way to keep up is by teaching yourself new skills. I enjoy diving deep into coding languages like Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS, and I’m always experimenting with new projects. Whether it’s building my own apps, exploring cloud computing, or learning about cybersecurity, I love challenging myself to grow and expand my knowledge.</p>
